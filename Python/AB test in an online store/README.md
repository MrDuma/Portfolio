## Project objectives:
Evaluate the results of the A/B test of changes related to the implementation of the improved recommendation system of the online store

## Skills and tools
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly
- scipy

## General output
We have analyzed the results of an A/B experiment on changes related to the implementation of an improved recommendation system. We have verified the accuracy of the test and removed data that did not meet the technical specifications. We have examined the distribution of the number of events per user in the samples and the distribution of the number of events over time, as well as the conversion funnels in each group. We have compared the shares of users who completed the same event in different groups using the Z-test for two proportions.

The general conclusion is that the results of the experiment are inconclusive. There are questions about the quality of the data and the design of the experiment. We recommend that you repeat the experiment, taking into account the identified shortcomings.
